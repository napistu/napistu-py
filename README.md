# Napistu Python Library

This Python package hosts the majority of the algorithmic code for the [Napistu project](https://github.com/napistu/napistu).

## Setup

Napistu is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/napistu) so the recommended way to use it is just to pip install with:

pip install .
```
